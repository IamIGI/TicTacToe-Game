# TicTacToe-Game
Python project of TicTacToe Game

To run game, simple start program and write top-l to moge to left upper corner, od mid-m to set 'X' in the middle of the board.
In game you have score tracker, that is show after round is finished

There are two sepparate files. I made them, because I don't want to make mess  in main file.
I could use class or functions to make main even more cleaer, but for now I want to write all functional code for the game without it.
